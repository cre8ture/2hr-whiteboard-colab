To create a test for an interview focused on integrating Playwright testing into a Next.js whiteboard project with specific features, you would want to ensure that the candidate demonstrates a clear understanding of both Playwright and Next.js, along with the ability to implement complex UI interactions. Here's how you can structure your test requirements:

### Interview Test: Playwright Testing in Next.js Whiteboard Project

#### Objective:
Implement a whiteboard feature in a Next.js application with the following capabilities:
1. **Drawing with Cursor:** Users should be able to draw on the whiteboard using their cursor.
2. **Text Input on Double Click:** Users can double-click on any area of the whiteboard to start typing text.

#### Requirements:

##### 1. Next.js Application Setup:
- Create a basic Next.js application.
- Implement a whiteboard area (canvas or similar) where users can interact.

##### 2. Drawing Feature:
- Implement drawing functionality:
  - The cursor should draw lines on the whiteboard when clicked and dragged.
  - Ensure smooth and responsive drawing experience.

##### 3. Text Input Feature:
- Implement text input on double-click:
  - A double-click on the whiteboard should allow the user to type text at that location.
  - The text box should be resizable and movable.

##### 4. Playwright Testing:
- Write Playwright tests to cover:
  - Drawing functionality: Test that lines are drawn on the whiteboard.
  - Text input: Test double-click interaction and text input.
  - General UI and integration tests for the whiteboard.

##### 5. Documentation:
- Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the project and tests.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality:** All features work as described.
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive tests with Playwright, ensuring all features are covered.
- **Documentation:** Clear instructions for setting up and testing the application.

#### Submission:
- Submit the code repository (e.g., GitHub link) containing the Next.js application and Playwright tests.
- Ensure the repository includes a README with setup and testing instructions.
